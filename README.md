Project Title: Analyzing App Ratings Distribution Across Categories Using Violin Plots

Project Overview:

This project aims to visualize the distribution of app ratings across different categories through a violin plot. The goal is to filter out irrelevant apps and provide insights into how specific app categories perform in terms of user ratings. The final visualization will help stakeholders compare app ratings across categories, focusing on apps that meet stringent filtering criteria.

Key Filters Applied:

    Category Filter: Include only categories with more than 50 apps to ensure a robust analysis with significant data representation.
    App Name Filter: Only include apps whose names contain the letter "C" (case-insensitive).
    Review Filter: Exclude apps with fewer than 10 reviews to ensure the inclusion of apps with a reasonable amount of user feedback.
    Rating Filter: Focus on apps with ratings below 4.0 to highlight those with potentially lower user satisfaction.
    Time Restriction: The plot will be generated and displayed only outside the hours of 6 PM to 11 PM.

Deliverables:

    A violin plot that visualizes the distribution of ratings for each app category meeting the filtering criteria.
    The plot will include only app categories with more than 50 apps, apps with names containing the letter "C," apps with at least 10 reviews, and ratings below 4.0.
    The visualization will be restricted from running between 6 PM and 11 PM.
